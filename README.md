Implementation of the basic simulation of underwater vehicles provided by Gazebo Sim documentation (https://gazebosim.org/api/sim/8/tutorials.html)
The repository contains 3 projects:

- Buoyant lander with detachable weight system implementing Buoyancy, Detachable Joint System, and Hydrodynamics plugins.
